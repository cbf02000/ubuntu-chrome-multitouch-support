  "readme": "# Caress Server#\n\n*Caress Server* is a NodeJS + Socket.io backed Javascript implementation of the [TUIO protocol](http://www.tuio.org) bringing true cross platform TUIO support. Used in conjunction with the the [Caress Client](https://github.com/ekryski/caress-client/) you now get true cross browser multi-touch support and tactile interaction in the web browser.\n\n### Background ###\n[TUIO](http://tuio.org/) is based on the [OSC protocol](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) and usually transferred via UDP. Caress uses NodeJS and websockets via ([Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)) to push OSC/TUIO messages to the browser. The Caress server listens for raw TUIO events, processes them, and then exposes them, as either an array or JSON, through an event emitter. Therefore consuming is as simple as listening for `'tuio'` events.\n\n## Getting Started\n### Server\n**Install the server via npm:**\n\n    npm install caress-server\n\n**To run an example:**\n\n* start the example server\n    * `node examples/server.js`\n* open up one of the html files\n* Grab a [TUIO Tracker](http://tuio.org/?software) and start playing around\n\n\nThe server listens for TUIO input on the default TUIO port: 3333. If you need to change this for some reason you can change it when you create a new TUIO server:\n\n    var CaressServer = require('caress-server');\n    var caress = new CaressServer('0.0.0.0', 3333, {json: true});\n\n    caress.on('tuio', function(msg){\n      console.log(msg);\n    });\n\nThat's it that's all. Now you can do whatever you want with that TUIO data.\n\n### Client\nGrab the [Caress Client](https://github.com/ekryski/caress-client/) and drop it into your web page.\n\n## Examples\n_See the [examples](https://github.com/ekryski/Caress/tree/master/examples) folder_\n\n## Contributing\nI am open to pull requests but make sure you include unit tests with your code.\n\n## Credits\nAlthough I did not collaborate with these individuals their work inspired me to create this project:\n\n* Boris Smus (https://github.com/borismus/MagicTouch)\n* Fajran Iman Rusadi (https://github.com/fajran/npTuioClient)\n* Andy Smith (https://github.com/termie/node-osc)\n* fe9lix (https://github.com/fe9lix/Tuio.js)\n* Esteban Ginez (https://github.com/eginez/MultitouchWebSockets)\n\n## MIT Licensed\nCopyright 2012 Eric Kryski\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
